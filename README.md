A SUPERVISED HYBRID STATISTICAL CATCH-UP SYSTEM BUILT ON GABECE GAMBIAN DATA

In this research paper, our aim is to develop a statistical approach that can be used to determine whether a student who missed one out of four exams should be declared as passing or failing. Dismissing a student as failing without considering their performance in the other exams is harsh and unfair, especially if the reason for their absence is not intentional. Therefore, it is essential to come up with a fair and unbiased approach that takes into account their overall performance.

To achieve this goal, we utilized a special classification method and nearest neighbors methods based on the average grade and the most modal grade. We employed these methods in a supervised learning process to build a robust statistical rule. Our approach provides a more nuanced evaluation of a student's performance, considering their overall score, as well as the distribution of their grades in the exams they took.

To test our approach, we used the GABECE educational data, a vast dataset covering seven years and all six regions of the Gambia. The dataset provides a rich source of information that allowed us to train and test our statistical rule comprehensively. Our results demonstrate that our approach can accurately predict whether a student should be declared as passing or failing, and it outperforms existing approaches that only consider the number of exams taken.

Overall, our research presents a practical and fair approach to evaluating a student's performance, which can provide more nuanced and accurate results than traditional methods. This approach has the potential to benefit students, teachers, and educational policymakers by providing a more comprehensive and fair evaluation of a student's performance.
